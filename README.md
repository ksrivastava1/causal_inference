# causal_inference
This is a repository for exploratory work on machine learning and causal inference. The work in focus is work by [Bernhard Scholkopf](https://icml.cc/2012/papers/625.pdf)

You can find a full exposition of the project and ideas at [my website](https://karansrivastava.com/project/causal-inference/)

The HSIC code here was from [github.com/amber0309](https://github.com/amber0309/HSIC) who adapted code from [this paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2007/file/d5cfead94f5350c12c322b5b664544c1-Paper.pdf). Check out the repository for more details on this.
